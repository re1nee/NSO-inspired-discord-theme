## Contributing

I need help with [Todo/Idea list](#todoidea-list), but any contributions or suggestions are welcome. Feel free to contribute to this project by forking this repository, making your changes, and submitting a pull request. Lastly please don't over do it, this theme is meant to be cute, simple, and user friendly (**don't change too much font or add too much animations, it will be hard to read and use**).
